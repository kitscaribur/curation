	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
		Fiction has existed since the beginning of time. Evolving from mythological oral tales to fantasy world-building, it has saturated our lives through cult classic animes, LARPing, story-rich games, and many other forms. Reimagining the site as an incubator for new fiction, the exhibition brings forth new ways of storytelling, exploring the role of fictional characters and their implications for our daily lives.
