<h3> About</h3>
	<p>
		The title primarily raises the question of how one’s identity can be predetermined by colors, a classic example being ‘pink for girls and blue for boys‘. This unspoken rule created a fake comfort zone for people, as we continue being fed with information convincing us that this is what we want. Under the current consumeristic structure, it is unclear if color is serving us or vice versa.	
		<br>
		<br>
		Art is a creative method of understanding one’s self that allows exploration and risk-taking. Many of the selected works here resulted in their current choice based on countless trials and errors. As the color palette becomes more specific, each work’s creative choice turns clearer, in some way, the current palette choices from many presenting artists presented the gradual extraction and fine-tuning of their previous practices. The current decision is a result of the consciousness and reflection on the past, therefore, to become Monochromatic is to embrace the knowledge of one’s self - to be comfortable through gradual confidence in a made choice. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Instead of a straightforward thematic presentation, this exhibition invites viewers to broaden their understanding of ‘monochrome’. Just like how the color grey can be formed by an infinite amount of RGB dots on a digital screen - so is black and white, ‘monochrome’ doesn’t need to simply indicate the description of colors, instead, it can be narrated through various mediums.
		<br>
		<br>
		Through a selection of performative and multimedium works, ‘monochrome’ becomes a description of humdrum life or a choice for closure; ‘comfort’ becomes less commendatory, and invites viewers to question the underlying uncertainty of what appears to be comfortable. With various stories told in each piece, Monochromatic Comfort presented the fluidity of the title’s interpretation and also revealed the ever-changing self, just like the evolution of creative decisions.
