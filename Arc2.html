	<p>“Arc 2”, derived from the second “arc”/sequence of a story, is a research project and event investigating the purpose and implication of fiction in today’s society. Using past cult-classic fictional works and analyzing the consumerism effect from within, “Arc 2” will present a series of relative topics such as “the cause and effect of digital hoarding”; “Otakus and their global influence”; “border or reality in young gamers”; and “Role Play Game (RPG) as a new habitat”. These discussions will be carried out as exhibitions, performances, and talks. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The goal of “Arc 2” is to bring artists related to the above-proposed field to attention. With selected presentations, “Arc 2” encourages viewers to think about how the artists’ area of practice affects the way people see and interact with art/art space nowadays. Curatorially in the future, “Arc 2” will be a temporary space to support young multidisciplinary artists’ practice through collective discussion on the current environment of the contemporary art scene, and their thoughts on the sustainability of digital/multi-media art.
